FPL Constraints

Picking Team Constraints
Budget = 100m
2 Keepers
5 Defenders
5 Forwards
3 Midfielders
Max 3 players from one team

Picking Starting 11 for GW
1 Keeper
Minimum 3 Defenders
Minimum 1 Forward

For each Gameweek, I want to pick the best 11 players that a guaranteed to give me the highest points?
    -- What determines the highest points per player?
        A: It varies by position, for defenders/Goalkeepers - Clean sheets are important, goals too but unlikely
            for midfielders and attackers.. its goals and assists

-------- Picking A Team -------
FIRST TIME
    -- use Historical and gameweek 1 Fixtures
        -- assert gameweek 1 or team is not picked??
        -- Finding historical number of games played seems to be a challenge.

    -- Only add players who played over 90 mins
    -- Changed that to 500 minutes
    -- ROI_per_MIN prioritizes LOW Minutes, players that perform well do not have high ROI's
    -- Might use ROI_per_MIN for specific scenarios?

Machine Learning....

A gameweek has a set of fixtures eg
    -- Man Utd vs Chelsea
    -- Arsenal vs Man City

What am I trying to Predict????
 - For a Given Gameweek, looking at the players and fixtures for that gameweek... I want pick the team will maximize
 my ROI(points/player)

 - I am unable to get historical fixture data...
 - Should I get THIS Seasons Data and then

 Form_Points_Differential(FPD)
 When two teams are playing each other, the FPD for that fixture for a particular gameweek is:
 - The difference between the points of the home team - points of the away team in the last x games
    - The FPD is just my numerical interpretation of a fixture value for machine learning purposes
    (x is typically 3 but tests will be done with x=4, x=5)
        - Just like points in the English premier league, if a team has a strong form of WWW in its last three games
        is are going up against a team whose form is WLW. The FPD is 9-6 = 3


Function to pick players
    -- Top performing players
    -- ROI List
    --

WWW vs LWL
9-3 = 6

get_teams Needs to be updated for historical teams too (historical = true) and seasonyear provided as args

x-values = Direct Goal Contributions, Points Per Game, Total points, Team FDR, ROI

TODO
-- Identify underperforming players

-- How often should this run
    -- before every gameweek
        -- every Thursday at 8pm

- Get the

---Current Workflow
- Run GetCurrentData to get a CSV of current Data for the season and current GW
- Run notebook to create model with histo


--Future Workflow
    -- is it the Start of the season?
        YES?
          -- Use gameweek 1 or (1-5) and Last Seasons data to pick team
        NO?
          -- Use currentSeasons Data + next Gameweek to pick team


Simple bot flow
-- identify underperforming players in my team (max Three)
    -- Player Pool
    -- Your team
-- Transfer the underperforming players for high ROI players that are affordable/within budget/within restrictions
   -- Who EXACTLY would I transfer
-- Sort and Set Team
